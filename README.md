# Big Brain Energy

This project is a replication of a study where researchers gathered brainwave information using an EEG headband technology called Skyware. Skyware captures a participant's brainwaves and uses Fourier Transformations to separate the brain signals into distinct brainwaves (Alpha, Beta, Delta and Theta).
